//! Color is a Rust crate which implements color space conversions, targeting at least
//! [CSS Color Level 4].
//!
//! ## Scope and goals
//!
//! Color in its entirety is an extremely deep and complex topic. It is completely impractical
//! for a single crate to meet all color needs. The goal of this one is to strike a balance,
//! providing color capabilities while also keeping things simple and efficient.
//!
//! The main purpose of this crate is to provide a good set of types for representing colors,
//! along with conversions between them and basic manipulations, especially interpolation. A
//! major inspiration is the [CSS Color Level 4] draft spec; we implement most of the operations
//! and strive for correctness.
//!
//! A primary use case is rendering, including color conversions and methods for preparing
//! gradients. The crate should also be suitable for document authoring and editing, as it
//! contains methods for parsing and serializing colors with CSS Color 4 compatible syntax.
//!
//! Simplifications include:
//!   * Always using `f32` to represent component values.
//!   * Only handling 3-component color spaces (plus optional alpha).
//!   * Choosing a fixed, curated set of color spaces for dynamic color types.
//!   * Choosing linear sRGB as the central color space.
//!   * Keeping white point implicit.
//!
//! A number of other tasks are out of scope for this crate:
//!   * Print color spaces (CMYK).
//!   * Spectral colors.
//!   * Color spaces with more than 3 components generally.
//!   * [ICC] color profiles.
//!   * [ACES] color transforms.
//!   * Appearance models and other color science not needed for rendering.
//!   * Quantizing and packing to lower bit depths.
//!
//! The [`Rgba8`] type is a partial exception to this last item, as that representation
//! is ubiquitous and requires special logic for serializing to maximize compatibility.
//!
//! Some of these capabilities may be added as other crates within the `color` repository,
//! and we will also facilitate interoperability with other color crates in the Rust
//! ecosystem as needed.
//!
//! ## Main types
//!
//! The crate has two approaches to representing color in the Rust type system: a set of
//! types with static color space as part of the types, and [`DynamicColor`]
//! in which the color space is represented at runtime.
//!
//! The static color types come in three variants: [`OpaqueColor`] without an
//! alpha channel, [`AlphaColor`] with a separate alpha channel, and [`PremulColor`] with
//! premultiplied alpha. The last type is particularly useful for making interpolation and
//! compositing more efficient. These have a marker type parameter, indicating which
//! [`ColorSpace`] they are in. Conversion to another color space uses the `convert` method
//! on each of these types. The static types are open-ended, as it's possible to implement
//! this trait for new color spaces.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `std` (enabled by default): Get floating point functions from the standard library
//!   (likely using your target's libc).
//! - `libm`: Use floating point implementations from [libm][].
//! - `bytemuck`: Implement traits from `bytemuck` on [`AlphaColor`], [`OpaqueColor`],
//!   [`PremulColor`], and [`Rgba8`].
//!
//! At least one of `std` and `libm` is required; `std` overrides `libm`.
